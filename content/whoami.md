# > whoami

As I enter the month of my 30th Birthday, I've decided to make a home for personal reflection and project updates.
This website is that new home. To begin this journey, I thought I would reflect on how I got here. In particular, how I got into technology,
what my specific interests are and what things I aim to explore in the future.

# "No need to argue momma, I've made us money!"
I'm choosing to start my story before I ever even touched a computer. I'm doing this to highlight a truth about myself. Like many others, I've always hated to admit that money would have anything to do with my motivations. "I just want to build great things!" "I just want to make the world a better place!" "I want to empower people!". These are the messages I want to say to myself and other people. However, as is often the case, the reality isn't so simple. I *do* want all those things, but at the end of the day, I know I am intensely driven by a desire to provide.

I grew up in a passionate, loving, evangelical, and very low-income family. My childhood defined by ups and downs in nourishment and accommodations. My first moments of life I lived in, what felt, a mansion in Pennsylvania. Better-off members of the family had provided us the housing, in hopes that it would enable our family to thrive. Quickly, however, things changed. Before I had turned 3, my father had decided it was his mission to bring the gospel to the world. Following him, we left our comfortable accommodations traveling through the United States sharing the scripture.

I don't have many memories from this time. However, there is one story I've heard that demonstrates well what life was like for the Crosley family at that point. As we traveled from city to city, staying with other believers when we had the opportunity, occasionally we were forced to use temporary accommodation. Without much money coming in, this certainly didn't mean a hotel. On one particular night, we made a tent to sleep right outside of a city. With me being the youngest (2 years of age at the time) my parents laid me on the one comfortable piece of bedding that they brought with them. As it grew late, I fell asleep on what resembled a small air mattress. However, to my family's dismay, a thunderstorm rolled in as we began to sleep. With no other choice, everyone attempted to sleep through it. As we slept, the rain got more and more intense, until it caused flooding that rushed into our tent. Everyone awoke and started grabbing their few personal belongings, with the hope of rushing to somewhere drier. In the panic, they didn't realize that I had started to float away. I always was a deep sleeper. However, while I did float outside of the tent, I didn't make it too far, before my parents realized what had happened, panicked and found me. Everything was okay. However, it was so close to not being okay. There is no better way to put my early years, than always toeing the line between everything being okay and not.

Naturally, at some point, my parents grew tired of this. With few options, they reached out to my dad's parents, hoping they would put us up as we got back onto our feet. At four, I found myself, and the rest of the family living at my Grandparents. Here is where I find my first complete memory formed.  My grandparents were always the kindest, most hospitable and loving people I knew. However, it was hard for my father to accept help and admit the challenges he faced. He wanted us to go back to being on our own. I remember one night, overhearing my parents arguing in the other room. As I pushed my ear against the wall that separated us, all I could overwhelmingly hear was money. I didn't know what exactly it was about money that had my parents in such a fit, but at the very least it seemed like more couldn't be a problem. So, I went to work. My grandparents had left crayons and paper in my room, so I did my best drawing as much money as I could. After drawing two full sheets, I busted into my parent's room. "No need to argue momma, I've made us money!". Everything was okay. However, it was so close to not being okay. I had fixed it. At least, I thought.


# "Buy a copy! It's cheap!"
Eventually, we did move back out. This time, however, we didn't last too long on the road before settling down, seemingly for good. My dad had secured a stable job at an evangelical home for troubled kids, and the local church rented us out a house they owned, for much less than the market rate. The house was old, in need of love, and certainly full of asbestos. However, it was easily large enough for our entire family — only 2 of the 4 of us kids needed to share a room. We had found a home.

My father, to his credit, realized technology *had* to be the future. And he always wanted more than anything for all of us to succeed. We had almost nothing frivolous in the house, but one day he came home with a portal to that future. At around the same time Windows 95 came out, we got our first computer. It, of course, didn't run Windows 95. It came from a pawn shop and ran only MS-Dos. It was perfect.

There was very little of anything on the computer. At first, this disappointed me. I heard technology was limitless! This computer only had Edit and this mysterious application called QBasic. After a brief, but very enjoyable sidetrack contained within the "Commander Keen" floppy my dad was also able to secure, I decided I wanted to discover QBasic. Luckily, it came with built-in help. In retrospect, this was the first time I learned the lesson that while boundless options have a broad appeal, limits are often even more empowering. Had I had the entire internet, after all, I would have collected every game there was, and maybe never learned to code at all.

At the time, and throughout my entire pre-adult life, I was home-schooled. My mom did her best to teach me but was always too ill to give it her full attention. No worries, this year we tried an off the shelf curriculum. Quickly, I found myself less and less interested in the curriculum and more and more interested in the computer. When I did do my curriculum, I did everything I could to work the computer into it. I built memorization software for tests and made my own slightly gamified math quizzes. And of course, QBasic functions as a calculator in a pinch. My siblings couldn't understand: "What are you doing, Tim? We already beat Commander Keen!"

Of course, my siblings were right. We had run out of games. And while I had successfully used QBasic to help me out with homework, we all knew that the real purpose of a computer was for interactive entertainment. So, I did the only thing I could. I tried my best to make a game in QBasic. The first few were simple. ASCII art, a choice prompt, with the ASCII art updating after each choice submission. It was enough to get me even more hooked. I would sneak out of my bed at night, as I thought of different ways to make the game better. I remember one night, remembering reading something in the documentation, that might enable me to make my games not require the enter key to submit each action. I ran downstairs until I got it working. I then stayed up all night, making my first game that utilized my discovery. It couldn't have been more worth it.

☻♥☺

This first game still used ASCII art, but it was fully interactive. You could move your little character on the platforms, and jump on and over enemies. Of course, the enemies still only moved when you did, but I still thought it was the coolest thing I had ever seen. It was something I had thought of and created, and it worked. With my limited available canvas, all characters were rendered using one of the two available smiley characters, and with my limited imagination, I called my creation "Smiley".

I remember being so excited when my Grand Parents came to visit. They always brought sweets and would take our whole family out to eat! And, I missed them, even though it seemed the family was finally getting along just fine. They also had a new gadget, a camcorder, and of course, they wanted to film their grandchildren. Being the youngest at 6, I was a guaranteed target. Of course, for me, it was still about the computer. I took the opportunity to tell the broad audience (that I was sure the camera represented) about my new game. "You should buy my new game! It's super fun, interactive, and only $1!" "Buy a copy! It's cheap!" I exclaimed to the camera. I guess I was still trying to draw up new money. No one ever did buy the game, but it didn't matter, I had already fallen in love with programming.

# "Windoze Sucks!"
As the years went on, I kept on programming. And, still, in the one tool, I quickly had available: QBasic. It seemed like not a single day would go by without code going to the keyboard. Eventually, my parents brought me to the local library, where there was the internet. I scoured as much information as I could about programming. I made many games, then a custom tool to launch my games, then a graphical windowing environment called SystemX. I also occasionally did some traditional studying. Much less than I was supposed to, but it seemed that no one cared as long as I kept scoring in the 99 percentile in the required standardized tests. I learned a lot in this time, but I knew in the back of my head that I also missed out on a lot. One thing I never did was hang out with kids my age, and when I did, none of them seemed to understand me. How can I blame them? I didn't understand them either.

At some point, our lives were stable enough that our parents gave us an allowance of 25 cents a week. It was enough to buy a Little Debbie or another unhealthy snack at the local corner store. It wasn't much, but it didn't matter: I rarely saw those 25 cents. Every once in a while, we make a trip to a book store, and I would beg my dad to allow me an advance to buy a programming book I thought looked cool. Occasionally, he had no choice but to say no, but more often, he made it work. I gobbled them all up. And everything I learned I immediately tested out. It was addicting and fun. Everything I built is now gone, none of it still useful, but the lessons I learned back then undoubtedly made me the person I am today. I probably still owe him some quarters.

Three years later, at nine years old, my mom had gotten particularly ill, so I and the rest of my siblings were forced to make a trip back to my Grand Parents. I couldn't know it then, but I was about to encounter something that would change the course of my life forever. I wasn't allowed to drag along our Family computer, and was terrified of being away from it, but thrilled to see my Grand Parents. Luckily, they did have a computer — an old IBM PS/2. And a ton of games on floppy disks. Including "Freddies Rescue Roundup." It reminded me of the games I had built, and my Grand Fathers name was Fred. I loved it! However, I never was able to spend to much time on that computer, and certainly, never write much code.

My Grand Parents, recognizing my strong desire to code, started paying me to do chores around their house and taking me to the local computer store. Over a few months, I ended up with a Frankenstein 386 PC built from the remnants of no longer working computers. The case had a turbo button, but it never got connected to anything on the motherboard. No worries, I didn't need a button to make my computer go slower. I only needed to be compatible with the *future*. I built the computer in the room my grandparents had put me up in, and spent hours on it every day. At this point, I got more and more enamored with the graphics the computer could make. I made little animated shorts and a personal assistant that would respond to questions thrown its way. All still through QBasic and powered by an ungodly number of GOTO statements and MS-Dos.

While I was busy coding, my siblings were busy doing what kids are supposed to during the summer: making friends and going outside. I couldn't understand it at the time, but I am incredibly grateful they did this. My brother, who always liked getting into trouble, made friends with a local kid with the same appetite for chaos. That summer they played with explosives, fought with people in the neighborhood, and tried to teach each-other karate. My brother, no matter how many times we argued, always expressed pride in my technical abilities. One day he invited his new friend over and had me show him the latest program I had been building. My brother's friend, Joe, thought it was cool. However, he asked "Why are you using Dos?", "Why not Windows?". It was a good question, but one with only one answer: "I can't afford it." Joe told me to stay put, while he rushed back to his house and came back with a CD with the text "Mandrake" scribbled on it.

Over the next few hours, we installed one of the first versions of Mandrake Linux on my old 386. The whole experience was dazzling to me. We, of course, ran into several installation issues, but in the end, I had a modern mouse-driven interface. And it had more programs and compilers then I could have dreamed. Mandrake Linux was my first exposure to Open Source, and it had me hooked. Hundreds of programmers from around the world had worked tirelessly to give me this gift. They brought me into the future, and they asked for nothing in return. To me, Open Source was and still is, about empowerment. About the recognization, that when we stop fighting and start collaborating, we all go farther and faster. Seeing this, I couldn't understand why anyone would use windows and quickly became a Linux zealot. "Windoze Sucks!" I would proudly pronounce, of course, I had barely ever touched Windows. In the end, my zealousness was just a childish expression of indebtedness.
