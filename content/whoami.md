# > whoami

As I enter the month of my 30th Birthday, I've decided to make a home for personal reflection and project updates.
This website is that new home. To begin this journey, I thought I would reflect on how I got here. In particular, how I got into technology,
what my specific interests are and what things I aim to explore in the future.

# "No need to argue momma, I've made us money!"
I'm choosing to start my story before I ever even touched a computer. I'm doing this to highlight a truth about myself. Like many others, I've always hated to admit that money would have anything to do with my motivations. "I just want to build great things!" "I just want to make the world a better place!" "I want to empower people!". These are the messages I want to say to myself and other people. However, as is often the case, the reality isn't so simple. I *do* want all those things, but at the end of the day, I know I am intensely driven by a desire to provide.

I grew up in a passionate, loving, evangelical, and very low-income family. My childhood defined by ups and downs in nourishment and accommodations. My first moments of life I lived in, what felt, a mansion in Pennsylvania. Better-off members of the family had provided us the housing, in hopes that it would enable our family to thrive. Quickly, however, things changed. Before I had turned 3, my father had decided it was his mission to bring the gospel to the world. Following him, we left our comfortable accommodations traveling through the United States sharing the scripture.

I don't have many memories from this time. However, there is one story I've heard that demonstrates well what life was like for the Crosley family at that point. As we traveled from city to city, staying with other believers when we had the opportunity, occasionally we were forced to use temporary accommodation. Without much money coming in, this certainly didn't mean a hotel. On one particular night, we made a tent to sleep right outside of a city. With me being the youngest (2 years of age at the time) my parents laid me on the one comfortable piece of bedding that they brought with them. As it grew late, I fell asleep on what resembled a small air mattress. However, to my family's dismay, a thunderstorm rolled in as we began to sleep. With no other choice, everyone attempted to sleep through it. As we slept, the rain got more and more intense, until it caused flooding that rushed into our tent. Everyone awoke and started grabbing their few personal belongings, with the hope of rushing to somewhere drier. In the panic, they didn't realize that I had started to float away. I always was a deep sleeper. However, while I did float outside of the tent, I didn't make it too far, before my parents realized what had happened, panicked and found me. Everything was okay. However, it was so close to not being okay. There is no better way to put my early years, than always toeing the line between everything being okay and not.

Naturally, at some point, my parents grew tired of this. With few options, they reached out to my dad's parents, hoping they would put us up as we got back onto our feet. At four, I found myself, and the rest of the family living at my Grandparents. Here is where I find my first complete memory formed.  My grandparents were always the kindest, most hospitable and loving people I knew. However, it was hard for my father to accept help and admit the challenges he faced. He wanted us to go back to being on our own. I remember one night, overhearing my parents arguing in the other room. As I pushed my ear against the wall that separated us, all I could overwhelmingly hear was money. I didn't know what exactly it was about money that had my parents in such a fit, but at the very least it seemed like more couldn't be a problem. So, I went to work. My grandparents had left crayons and paper in my room, so I did my best drawing as much money as I could. After drawing two full sheets, I busted into my parent's room. "No need to argue momma, I've made us money!". Everything was okay. However, it was so close to not being okay. I had fixed it. At least, I thought.
